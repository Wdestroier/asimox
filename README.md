# domino - a DOM library in Dart

Inspired by Google's [incremental-dom](http://google.github.io/incremental-dom/)
library, `package:domino` is a Dart-native DOM library supporting incremental DOM
updates, efficient event handling and reuse.

NOTE: early version of the package did use virtual DOM, which is a use-case that
can be supported via incremental DOM too.
